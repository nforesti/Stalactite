# Stalactite
My first attempt at data visualization for Vis 41 (Design Communication). My project theme was related to isolation, so I searched
datasets on Kaggle. I wanted to see what would happen when I plotted the data of a suicide dataset. It made a very
interesting image, so I played around more with the styling.

## Note on the datasource
I got the data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016). In newdataplot.csv,
I only got the US data and from 1993 to 2015. I then isolated the columns: year, age, suicides_no, and population. Sorting
the data also does some really cool things to the image. I also changed the values of the age group to the average of the range.
newdataplot.csv is the dataset I've used. originalUS.xlsx is the original data with all of the columns (only the US data).
